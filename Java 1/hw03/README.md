# HW02, Java 1
This homework builds on the one before it. Some better implementations of collections framework are given, some refactoring is done etc.
However, the largest part of this homework is the creation of a lexer + parser for a made-up scripting language "smartscript". The whole implementation is done from scratch, and the end result is a simple, but fully functional lexer and parser. The parser is further built upon in the third homework of the second part of the course, Java 2, where an engine is created which can execute the scripts written in Smartscript.

In order to open and run this homework localy, download the source code (meaning the entire hwXX-0036516265 folder, including the folder). Then using Eclipse or a similar IDE, do the following steps:
Import/Projects from folder or archive/Folder and select the folder you just downloaded.
