# HW06, Java 1
This homework is an introduction to multithreading in Java. First, a calculator which can work with complex numbers is implemented. Then, that same calculator is used to implement a fractal-produced, and an external library is used to show the fractal. More "manual" form of hyperthreading is used to parallelise the calculation, serving more as proof of concept than as practical multithreading.

This homework cannot be run locally, as it depends on a library created by our professor, prof. Marko Čupić, and as I didn't ask for his permisson to use the library, I'm not including it here.
