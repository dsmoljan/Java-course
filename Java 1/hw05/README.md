# HW05, Java 1
This is one of my favourite homeworks :)

It has 2 main parts:
In the first part, a command line program which can encrypt and decrypt messahes using the AES encryption algoritm, or calculate and check SHA256 message digest.
The second part of the homework is a simplified implementation of a shell, including commands such as ls, cat, tree, rm and others.

In order to open and run this homework localy, download the source code (meaning the entire hwXX-0036516265 folder, including the folder). Then using Eclipse or a similar IDE, do the following steps:
Import/Projects from folder or archive/Folder and select the folder you just downloaded.
