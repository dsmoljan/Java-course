# HW04, Java 1
This homework includes an implementation of a fractal drawer and a simple implementation of a command line database, which stores entries in a .txt file.

First part of this homework cannot be run locally, as it depends on a library created by our professor, prof. Marko Čupić, and as I didn't ask for his permisson to use the library, I'm not including it here. 
To run the second part of this homework, follow these instructions: 
In order to open and run this homework localy, download the source code (meaning the entire hwXX-0036516265 folder, including the folder). Then using Eclipse or a similar IDE, do the following steps:
Import/Projects from folder or archive/Folder and select the folder you just downloaded.
