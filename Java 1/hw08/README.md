# HW07, Java 1
This is by far the largest and most complex homework we had to do in the course, and one of the most complex assigments I've had to do on uni so far. The end result is a fully functional JNotepad++ clone. I won't say more, try it for yourself!

In order to open and run this homework localy, download the source code (meaning the entire hwXX-0036516265 folder, including the folder). Then using Eclipse or a similar IDE, do the following steps:
Import/Projects from folder or archive/Folder and select the folder you just downloaded.
