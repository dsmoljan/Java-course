# HW01, Java 2
The first homework in the second part of the course continues the story on multithreading, this time using Java libraries, such as Executors, ThreadPools, ForkJoinPools etc. The end result is the same as in hw05 in the first part of the course, just created more elegantly and efficently.

Sadly, this is also one of the homeworks which depend on the professors .jar, so it cannot be run locally.
